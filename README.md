PES bus reservation system

Pes bus reservation system is web based application. It has been developed for
comfort of college students as well as faculty. It has been designed such that there will be
a portal that will get opened at a particular duration of every day (for around 15 minutes
or so), so that user can login into their respective account on the portal in order to pre-
book seat for themselves. The registration and sign up will be based on the login ID
given to them by the college transportation department. Once a user login he/she can
select the seat of their choice also if it is available.

The key part is that a particular user can book only single seat once on a particular day
with the features of choosing seat of his/her choice provided that seat is available.

The main aim of implementing in such a way is that a genuine user who comes to bus
stop early can now get to sit as his/her seat is already booked, it minimally matters how
much ever he/she comes late, gets to sit on the condition that the person has to book as
early as possible.
